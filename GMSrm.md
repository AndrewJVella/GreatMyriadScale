# Great Myriad Scale

Large numbers are commonly named with Latin prefixes, but these Latin names can be difficult to parse.  First, similar names are easily confused (such as "million" and "billion"). Second, with multiple scales in use, values can be ambiguous (one billion is equal to 10^9 or 10^12 depending on use of the short or long scale.) Finally, these parsing difficulties are exacerbated as values increase. (How much is a decillion in the short scale? The Latin for ten is used for one thousand to the eleventh. Madness.) I propose a scale derived from ancient Greek which I call the Great Myriad Scale. (Ok so, this scale actually uses English, with Greco-Latin roots and a bit of wordplay. Spare me your wrath.) The Great Myriad Scale is intended to be an unambiguous scale for counting large numbers. It is based on the myriad, classically equal to ten thousand. Essentially, this scale is intended to be a practical naming convention for impractically large numbers.

Let's start with a table to count from one to one myriad:

| n  | Name   | n  | Name       | n      | Name                       |      
|----|--------|----|------------|--------|----------------------------|
| 1  | One    | 12 | Twelve     | 30     | Thirty                     |
| 2  | Two    | 13 | Thirteen   | 40     | Forty                      |
| 3  | Three  | 14 | Fourteen   | 50     | Fifty                      |
| 4  | Four   | 15 | Fifteen    | 60     | Sixty                      |
| 5  | Five   | 16 | Sixteen    | 70     | Seventy                    |
| 6  | Six    | 17 | Seventeen  | 80     | Eighty                     |
| 7  | Seven  | 18 | Eighteen   | 90     | Ninety                     |
| 8  | Eight  | 19 | Nineteen   | 100    | One Hundred                |
| 9  | Nine   | 20 | Twenty     | 500    | Five Hundred               |
| 10 | Ten    | 21 | Twenty One | 1000   | Ten Hundred (One Thousand) |
| 11 | Eleven | 22 | Twenty Two | 1,0000 | One Myriad  (Ten Thousand) |

So, one hundred is the square of ten, and one myriad is the square of one hundred. What is the square of a myriad called? The powers of a myriad do have a naming scheme, described below.

## The Myriad Powers

In this scale each power of the myriad get an ancient Greek prefix and an "-iad" suffix. For example "deuteriad" is a myriad to the second power. it is named by shortening "deuteros myriad", with "deuteros" referring to "second". Each successive power follows this scheme:   

| n  | Name        | n  | Name            | n      | Name             |    
|----|-------------|----|-----------------|--------|------------------|
| 1  | Myriad      | 12 | Dodecatiad      | 30     | Tricontiad       |
| 2  | Deuteriad   | 13 | Decatotritiad   | 40     | Tetracontiad     |
| 3  | Tritiad     | 14 | Decatotetariad  | 50     | Pentacontiad     |
| 4  | Tetariad    | 15 | Decatopemptiad  | 60     | Hexacontiad      |
| 5  | Pemptiad    | 16 | Decatohectiad   | 70     | Heptacontiad     |
| 6  | Hectiad     | 17 | Decatohebdomiad | 80     | Octacontiad      |
| 7  | Hebdomiad   | 18 | Decatogdiad     | 90     | Enneacontiad     |
| 8  | Ogdiad      | 19 | Decatenatiad    | 100    | Hecatoniad       |
| 9  | Enatiad     | 20 | Icosiad         | 500    | Pemptohecatoniad |
| 10 | Decatiad    | 21 | Icosoprotiad    | 1000   | Decatohecatoniad |
| 11 | Hendecatiad | 22 | Icosodeuteriad  | 1,0000 | Great Myriad     |

(I did not strictly use Greek ordinals for this naming convention, switching to polygonal prefixes for 20 to 100. This choice was made for the sake of readability.)

Each power  of the myriad is named in this pattern until the Great Myriad, which gives this scale its name. The Great Myriad is equal to the myriad raised to the power of a myriad, which is ten to the power of forty thousand. The powers of the Great Myriad are also named with "Great", such that the square of the Great Myriad is the "Great Deuteriad", the cube of the Great Myriad is the "Great Tritiad", and so on. Is that it? No, of course there is more to discuss. Infinity is very big.

##The Great Myriads

Of course, by raising the Great Myriad to the power of a myriad, we get a "Great, Great Myriad". Raise this to the power of a myriad again to get  a "Great, Great, Great Myriad" and so on. To keep names short, a nucleic naming scheme is used (swapping the  suffix used in the above table for "-on"). The "Great, Great Myriad" is called the "Deuteron Myriad". The "Great, Great, Great Myriad" is called the "Triton Myriad", and so on according to the following table, with each item Each item in row n equal to 1,0000^(1,0000^n)

| n  | Name       | n  | Name           | n      | Name                   |    
|:--:|:----------:|:--:|:--------------:|:------:|:----------------------:|
| 1  | Great      | 12 | Dodecaton      | 30     | Triconton              |
| 2  | Deuteron   | 13 | Decatotriton   | 40     | Tetraconton            |
| 3  | Triton     | 14 | Decatotetaron  | 50     | Pentaconton            |
| 4  | Tetaron    | 15 | Decatopempton  | 60     | Hexaconton             |
| 5  | Pempton    | 16 | Decatohecton   | 70     | Heptaconton            |
| 6  | Hecton     | 17 | Decatohebdomon | 80     | Octaconton             |
| 7  | Hebdomon   | 18 | Decatogdon     | 90     | Enneaconton            |
| 8  | Ogdon      | 19 | Decatoenaton   | 100    | Hecaton                |
| 9  | Enaton     | 20 | Icoson         | 500    | Pemptohecaton          |
| 10 | Decaton    | 21 | Icosoproton    | 1000   | Decatohecaton          |
| 11 | Hendecaton | 22 | Icosodeuteron  | 1,0000 | Myrion                 |

This scheme continues to infinity, with "Myrion Myriad" being followed by "Myriaproton Myriad", which is then followed by "Myriadeuteron Myriad", and so on.  

## Why?

Well, there are only so many names, there can only be so much wordplay. To keep all the numbers countable, their names needed to be constructed from smaller numbers. Sure, you can start naming with hyperoperations, but they grow faster, and faster and soon you have an unstable scaffold stretched over growing, turbulent voids ever more difficult to bridge. If you cannot count to a number, then such a number is really a vague suggestion of magnitude, a dream of many zeroes... Oh, you meant "Why invent this counting scale thing anyway? Millions are fine, and we already have scientific notation, and who would ever count from one to myriamyrion myriad anyway?" Well, have you ever played one of those incremental video games, with all the numbers going up to astronomical absurdity? You wake up to "Hey, while you were sleeping, you got twenty quattuorvigintillion points in the tower of tumbleweeds!", and you remember all the sheep you counted last night, hoping for rest, because in the morning, you have a fracture to tend. You have to prevent muscular atrophy by isometrically flexing a muscle several hundred times, and that means even more counting. So you make up new names for new numbers, to spice it up.

You ask yourself "Where do all the number names come from anyway, and when do we run out?" and lo, the rabbit hole! It opens before you to a wonderland of Latin and "googology", and before you realize it you have let the number goblins in. They shout "We want an incremental game! One where players can read all the numbers!" They jump on the bed. "Notations! Bah! Fie on notations!" The number goblins demand a sense of scale. "Notations transform orders of magnitude into mere increments! Madness! People need names! Names!" They grab hold of the bed knobs and shake. The leader shouts in your ear "Don't you understand?! Do it for Archimedes!" The chanting begins. "Conway! Weschler! Knuth!". You are surrounded in a cacophonous, cantankerous, chorus of contention! Then, in unison, a deep breath, and the call of a great horn. "Millinillinillinillinyllion!" With this incantation you are changed, goblinified! There is only one way to lift the spell! Give them their tables, and their powers of ten, so that they might count in numerological novelty until the end of all things!

## (Additional) Trivia
* Archimedes' largest Sand Number (the largest described in The Sand Reckoner) is equal to 10^(8 * 10^16), or a "Tetaron Deuterad".
* A "Deuteron Myriad" is equal to 10^(4 * 10^(4 * 2)), a "Triton Myriad" is equal to 10^(4 * 10^(4 * 3)), and so on...
* A "Myrion Myriad" is equal to 10^(4 * 10^(4 * 10^4))
* An apeirogon has an infinite number of sides; "apeiro" gives the Great Myriad Scale the "Apeirad" and the "Apeiron Myriad"
* "Cola's Enumeration" and the "Ordinal Myriad Scale" are previous attempts to enumerate large numbers, using the Conway Wechsler system, Greek ordinals, and hyperoperations. Ultimately, it is important that each name for a large number is based on the names of smaller numbers, rather than operations or notations. The numbers between "novel numbers", or "milestone numbers", also need to be nameable.
